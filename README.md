# ThruCO2

ThruCO2 lets you map a travel route, and calculates CO2 emissions of how you chose to get there. The app is hosted at /pacific-fjord-26309.herokuapp.com/ .

Do you drive to work, or take the subway? The app scores users on their travel choices, tracking commuting habits over time individually, or as a team.

(The app is currently undergoing updates, and some discrepancies have been found between local functionality and Heroku functionality.)
